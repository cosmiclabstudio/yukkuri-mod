<p align="center" style="font-size:30px"><strong>Yukkuri in Minecraft</strong></p>

This mod add various Touhou Project Yukkuris into Minecraft. For the Uninitiated, a Yukkuri is a seemingly magical construct in the Touhou Universe, devised by the Touhou Project Fandom, consisting of a disembodied head that is somehow able to move around, speak, and perform other activities, depsite the fact that they are only heads. There are different species of Yukkuri, at least one for each Touhou Character (A Lot), and each contain a unique bean paste filling. Whatever they eat magically turns into their bean paste. Their catchphrase is "Take it Easy", and so, a Yukkuri's only goal in life is to take it easy.
